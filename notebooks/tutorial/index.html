<h2 id="what-is-seqlike-all-about">What is SeqLike all about?</h2>
<p>SeqLike aims to be an omnibus Python object
that bridges between different sequence representations:
strings, SeqRecord objects, NumPy arrays, and more.
It draws heavily upon BioPython's SeqRecord objects, and in 
most cases can be a drop-in replacement with additional powerful features
that bioinformaticians familiar with BioPython
will absolutely love ❤️.  </p>

<p>SeqLike objects, as we mentioned above, are highly inspired by SeqRecord objects.
This means that, if you're used to dealing with collections of SeqRecord objects,
you can actually access the underlying attributes easily via the same attribute accessors.

<h2 id="working-with-collections-of-seqlikes-in-pandas">Working with collections of SeqLikes in Pandas</h2>
<p>SeqLike also aims to simplify common tasks when working with <em>collections</em> of sequences.
We provide extensive integration with pandas Series via accessor methods,
making life supremely easy.</p>
<p>Accessor methods are exposed by the automatically generated <code>.seq</code> attribute in all pandas Series objects.  If a Series is all SeqLikes, then this namespace will contain many helpful methods for working with them.  Many operations return a new Series of SeqLikes, which added to a DataFrame as a new column and then futher manipulated by using <code>.seq</code>, again.</p>
<p>Let's say we have the following sequences:</p>

<h3 id="creating-multiple-sequence-alignments">Creating Multiple Sequence Alignments</h3>
<p>Traditionally, multiple sequence alignments are a hassle:
you have to export the sequence collection to a FASTA file,
run a command line program that exports a text file,
and then read back the text file into Python.
With SeqLike, you have access to MAFFT to do multiple sequence alignments quickly and easily.</p>

<h3 id="bulk-conversion-to-array-forms">Bulk conversion to array forms</h3>
<p>Just as with single SeqLikes, we can convert a collection of SeqLikes
in a Pandas series into their array form.  The sequences are collated along the first (0th) axis.
They need not necessarily be pre-aligned, because padding happens by default.   These methods return NumPy arrays, which can be manipulated and viewed as normal.  Here we also plot an aligned, index encoded collection of sequences in matplotlib.</p>
